# cpp
This is a repository of my learning experience with C++

## StructuringFunction1
How to use:
1. Open your IDE. In my case, I use Visual Code Studio
2. Clone this repository
3. Go to the folder where you want to test the code, i.e. StructuringFunction1
4. On your terminal type 'g++ distance.cpp main.cpp'
5. Check the result by typing './a.out'

Why do we need to run two .cpp files? In this project, I separate the function distance into a separate file. We can also define the function below int main().
